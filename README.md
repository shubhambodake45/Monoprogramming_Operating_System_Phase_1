# Monoprogramming_Operating_System_Phase_1

#Project Title: Monoprogramming operating system. (Phase-1)

#Objective: 
    Main objective of this project is to design an operating system with the help of virtual machine.
            
#Software used: 
    Code::Blocks20.03 

#Language Used: 
    C Programming Language

#Project Description:
    In the phase1 of the project the design a virtual machine for the program execution is done.
    Virtual machine basically consists of instruction cycle of steps fetch, decode and execute. 
    Execution of the program is done with the help of different instructions of virtual machine. System program is written for getting desired output with the help of input and here input and output devices are the files.
